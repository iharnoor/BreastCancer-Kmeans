# BreastCancer-Kmeans
Clustering the data into benign or malignant using kMeans Algorithm

## Also tested the data with different algorithms 
* kNN
* Logistic Regression
* Hierarchical Clustering

## Results
g) Supervised Learning: Logistic regression with 25:75 data split Accuracy = 97%
   Supervised Learning: K-Nearest Neighbours with 25:75 data split Accuracy = 95%
   Can be even higher with Neural network.
   UnSupervised Learning: Hierarchical Clustering Accuracy = 77%"""
   UnSupervised Learning: kMeans Clustering Accuracy = 85%"""
